"""
pyinst: a set of high level front-end utilities for interfacing with 
SuperCollider. The basic idea is that there will be shells for basic synth 
types, that will interact with scsynth. The project will provide SynthDefs, 
written in SuperCollider, but it will be possible or recommended to replace 
the SynthDefs. We shall see how the idea develops.

Another way to look at it: PyInstrument is an update of ThyInstrument, which
was a lamebrained attempt at hosting a number of hard-coded synths, sequencers
and effects in a GUI environment. In other words, re-write Reason in sc. I 
will take a more sensible stance here, the basic idea will be the same  but the
stupidity will be different.
