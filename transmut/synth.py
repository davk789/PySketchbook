"""
synth.py

Run the supercollider synths from this python script. In short, I am generating
granular-ish sounds that draw from the cam.py for parameter data.

To be more specific about the sounds: Python will generate large numbers of 
short notes. The main paramters will be pitch, duration, and "direction" -- that
is, the synths will be modulated somehow.
